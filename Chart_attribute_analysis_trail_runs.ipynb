      "## Generated Questions and Answers:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Question:** How do the CO2 stabilization levels represented in Chart A (450, 550, 650, 750 ppm) compare in terms of GDP reduction with the percentage of baseline CO2 in Chart B?\n",
      "   - **Answer:** Chart A directly correlates different stabilization levels with their respective GDP reductions, while Chart B illustrates the impact of various percentage reductions from the baseline CO2 on GDP. As the stabilization levels in Chart A increase (e.g., from 450 to 750 ppm), it can be inferred that the GDP reduction percentage may also vary, indicating that higher stabilization levels might lead to different economic impacts. However, without cross-analyzing exact values, specific numerical comparisons cannot be made.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Question:** What trends can be observed in GDP reductions as the CO2 stabilization level increases in Chart A, and how does this relate to the data points within Chart B?\n",
      "   - **Answer:** As CO2 stabilization levels increase in Chart A, it is expected that a trend of increasing GDP reductions can be observed up to a certain point. For instance, scenarios with higher CO2 stabilization levels (like 750 ppm) may demonstrate a larger percentage GDP reduction. This trend may mirror the data points in Chart B, where greater reductions in baseline CO2 percentages could relate to larger GDP impacts, suggesting a reciprocal relationship where higher CO2 emissions correlate with greater economic losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Question:** Are there any correlations between the scenario identifiers in both charts, and what might this imply for policy-making?\n",
      "   - **Answer:** The scenario identifiers (A1B, A1T, A1FI, A2, B1, B2) noted in Chart A also appear in Chart B, allowing for correlations to be drawn. A consistent pattern where scenarios produce similar GDP reductions across both charts may indicate robust predictions that could guide policymakers in their strategies to mitigate CO2 emissions while considering economic impacts. For instance, if a certain scenario consistently shows lower GDP loss, it could advocate for specific policy actions aligning with that pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Question:** Given that Chart A displays distinct color-coded scenarios while Chart B uses a uniform color for data points, how does this affect data interpretation?\n",
      "   - **Answer:** The color differentiation in Chart A allows for a quick visual comparison between scenarios; one can easily identify which scenario corresponds to which GDP reduction at specific stabilization levels. In contrast, the uniformity of dark purple in Chart B diminishes the ability to quickly distinguish between the different scenarios. Consequently, while Chart A provides clarity in presenting multiple scenarios, Chart B may require deeper analysis to understand scenario-specific impacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Question:** What real-world implications could arise from the GDP reduction trends observed in these charts, particularly regarding climate policy?\n",
      "   - **Answer:** The observed GDP reduction trends across various scenarios suggest that as CO2 emissions potentially stabilize, economic activity might be adversely affected, reflecting the need for proactive climate policies. Policymakers may leverage these insights to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability, guiding investment in green technologies and strategies that minimize economic impact while achieving necessary CO2 reductions. Understanding these relations could lead to a more nuanced approach to tackling climate change, recognizing that both environmental and economic priorities must be managed together.\n"

      "## Analytical Questions and Answers:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Question 1:\n",
      "How do the predicted changes in energy technology outputs by 2100 in Chart B relate to historical CO2 levels and deep ocean temperatures in Chart A, particularly in terms of potential climate implications?\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Answer:\n",
      "Chart A shows that past atmospheric CO2 levels and deep ocean temperatures have fluctuated significantly over geological time, which were influenced by energy dynamics (like fossil fuel burning) and ice sheet levels. In contrast, Chart B models future energy outputs for various technologies (coal, gas, oil, nuclear, and biomass), projecting significant energy consumption scenarios for 2100. The connection here is twofold: if future energy outputs, particularly from fossil fuels (coal, gas, and oil), increase as projected, they are likely to push atmospheric CO2 levels higher, potentially mimicking historical changes seen in Chart A. If this increase mirrors the past spikes in CO2, similar warming trends could be expected, pressing deep ocean temperatures upwards and affecting ice volumes, as illustrated in Chart A.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Why This Question Matters:\n",
      "This question is significant because it synthesizes historical data with future projections to evaluate the potential impact of current energy choices on climate conditions. Understanding this relationship can guide policymakers in making informed decisions to mitigate climate change, highlighting the need for shifting towards renewable energy technologies to avoid replicating past detrimental trends.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Question 2:\n",
      "What insights can be drawn regarding the variance in CO2 emission scenarios projected for 2100 in Chart B and how they compare to the baseline atmospheric CO2 levels and proxy records from Chart A?\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Answer:\n",
      "Chart A shows historical fluctuations in atmospheric CO2 levels, including peak periods that correlate with certain energy consumption events. By analyzing Chart B, particularly the error margins in the 2100 scenario for baseline and intervention conditions, we observe a range of projected emissions. If the high-emission scenarios (particularly those relying heavily on coal and oil) in Chart B are realized, they could lead atmospheric CO2 levels to reach or exceed those aforementioned peak levels from Chart A. The variance in scenarios also illustrates different paths of energy consumption: more aggressive interventions could lead to significantly lower emissions. This highlights the wide span of possible future CO2 concentrations and underscored an important insight—our immediate energy policy choices can shape future atmospheric conditions profoundly.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Why This Question Matters:\n",
      "This inquiry highlights the contrast between baseline atmospheric conditions and potential future outcomes based on varying energy strategies. It emphasizes the impact of human intervention and regulatory measures on climate outcomes, providing a clearer view of how reducing fossil fuel reliance (as suggested by some intervention scenarios) can lead to more favorable climate trajectories as opposed to business-as-usual scenarios that can push CO2 levels to historically unprecedented extremes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Question 3:\n",
      "How does the representation of ice volume changes in Chart A relate to energy outputs and interventions suggested in Chart B, particularly when considering potential climate tipping points?\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Answer:\n",
      "Chart A shows ice volume changes represented against atmospheric CO2 and deep ocean temperatures, indicating that as CO2 levels rise, significant shifts in ice volume threshold may occur, potentially leading to tipping points in the climate system. Chart B outlines energy outputs for 2030 and 2100 across different technologies. If the projected outputs from fossil fuel technologies become reality, we may see a corresponding rise in CO2 leading to accelerated ice melting, echoed in the historical data of Chart A. Interventions that shift energy reliance away from fossil fuels (displayed in Chart B) suggest a potential to stabilize these ice volumes or delay tipping points, while lack of intervention could lead to drastic ice volume decreases as shown in Chart A.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Why This Question Matters:\n",
      "This question emphasizes the interdependence of energy consumption, ice volume, and broader climate system dynamics. Identifying these connections is crucial for predicting future climate behaviors and the potential onset of drastic environmental changes. Understanding how energy outputs could either mitigate or exacerbate climate shifts provides essential context for climate adaptation and mitigation strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Question 4:\n",
      "Considering the proxy methods for CO2 in Chart A, what can we infer about the credibility of future energy technology scenarios portrayed in Chart B, particularly regarding their impact on atmospheric and oceanic conditions?\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Answer:\n",
      "The diverse CO2 proxy methods in Chart A enhance understanding of the historical reliability of CO2 data, serving as a critical reference for interpreting Chart B's future energy scenarios. If data from these proxies suggest particular thresholds of CO2 conducive to significant climate change, we can contextualize the projections in Chart B. For example, if current coal-based scenarios (predicted to have high outputs) lead toward critical CO2 thresholds found historically, we can infer higher risks of surpassing these thresholds in the near future. Conversely, energy technologies that favor lower CO2 outputs (like nuclear or biomass) should align with targets that remain within safer climatic boundaries, as per proxy insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Why This Question Matters:\n",
      "This question engages with the reliability of data-driven predictions against established historical trends. It serves to bolster or question the projections made for future energy paths, underscoring the importance of validated historical evidence when contemplating future energy strategies. By integrating past CO2 behavior with future technology plans, this dialogue aids in forming robust climate action plans.\n"

In addition this mode emits the\n            `plotly_selected` event in drag modes \"lasso\" and\n            \"select\", but with no event data attached (kept for\n            compatibility reasons). The \"select\" flag enables\n            selecting single data points via click. This mode also\n            supports persistent selections, meaning that pressing\n            Shift while clicking, adds to / subtracts from an\n            existing selection. \"select\" with `hovermode`: \"x\" can\n            be confusing, consider explicitly setting `hovermode`:\n            \"closest\" when using this feature.

This way you can\n            modify arrays in-place rather than making a complete\n            new copy for an incremental change. If NOT provided,\n            `Plotly.react` assumes that data arrays are being\n            treated as immutable, thus any data array with a\n            different identity from its predecessor contains new\n            data.\n        dragmode\n            Determines the mode of drag interactions. \"select\" and\n            \"lasso\" apply only to scatter traces with markers or\n            text. \"orbit\" and \"turntable\" apply only to 3D scenes.\n        editrevision\n            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in\n            `editable: true` configuration, other than trace names\n            and axis titles.

This is intended to reduce the likelihood of\n            reusing the same color when you have many slices, but\n            you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided in the\n            trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.\n        font\n            Sets the global font. Note that fonts used in traces\n            and other layout components inherit from the global\n            font.\n        funnelareacolorway\n            Sets the default funnelarea slice colors. Defaults to\n            the main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you\n            specify a new list here it can still be extended with\n            lighter and darker colors, see\n            `extendfunnelareacolors`.\n        funnelgap\n            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of\n            adjacent location coordinates.\n        funnelgroupgap\n            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the\n            same location coordinate.\n        funnelmode\n            Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are\n            displayed on the graph.

Has only an effect only on graphs that have\n            been generated via forked graphs from the Chart Studio\n            Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-\n            premise).\n        hoverdistance\n            Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look for data\n            to add hover labels (-1 means no cutoff, 0 means no\n            looking for data). This is only a real distance for\n            hovering on point-like objects, like scatter points.\n            For area-like objects (bars, scatter fills, etc)\n            hovering is on inside the area and off outside, but\n            these objects will not supersede hover on point-like\n            objects in case of conflict.\n        hoverlabel\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Hoverlabel`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        hovermode\n            Determines the mode of hover interactions. If\n            \"closest\", a single hoverlabel will appear for the\n            \"closest\" point within the `hoverdistance`. If \"x\" (or\n            \"y\"), multiple hoverlabels will appear for multiple\n            points at the \"closest\" x- (or y-) coordinate within\n            the `hoverdistance`, with the caveat that no more than\n            one hoverlabel will appear per trace. If *x unified*\n            (or *y unified*), a single hoverlabel will appear\n            multiple points at the closest x- (or y-) coordinate\n            within the `hoverdistance` with the caveat that no more\n            than one hoverlabel will appear per trace. In this\n            mode, spikelines are enabled by default perpendicular\n            to the specified axis. If false, hover interactions are\n            disabled.\n        hoversubplots\n            Determines expansion of hover effects to other subplots\n            If \"single\" just the axis pair of the primary point is\n            included without overlaying subplots. If \"overlaying\"\n            all subplots using the main axis and occupying the same\n            space are included. If \"axis\", also include stacked\n            subplots using the same axis when `hovermode` is set to\n            \"x\", *x unified*, \"y\" or *y unified*.\n        iciclecolorway\n            Sets the default icicle slice colors.

Default is\n            `true` if there is a trace to show and any of these: a)\n            Two or more traces would by default be shown in the\n            legend. b) One pie trace is shown in the legend. c) One\n            trace is explicitly given with `showlegend: true`.\n        sliders\n            A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Slider`\n            instances or dicts with compatible properties\n        sliderdefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.sliderdefaults), sets the\n            default property values to use for elements of\n            layout.sliders\n        smith\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Smith` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        spikedistance\n            Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look for data\n            to draw spikelines to (-1 means no cutoff, 0 means no\n            looking for data). As with hoverdistance, distance does\n            not apply to area-like objects. In addition, some\n            objects can be hovered on but will not generate\n            spikelines, such as scatter fills.\n        sunburstcolorway\n            Sets the default sunburst slice colors. Defaults to the\n            main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a\n            new list here it can still be extended with lighter and\n            darker colors, see `extendsunburstcolors`.\n        template\n            Default attributes to be applied to the plot. This\n            should be a dict with format: `{'layout':\n            layoutTemplate, 'data': {trace_type: [traceTemplate,\n            ...], ...}}` where `layoutTemplate` is a dict matching\n            the structure of `figure.layout` and `traceTemplate` is\n            a dict matching the structure of the trace with type\n            `trace_type` (e.g. 'scatter'). Alternatively, this may\n            be specified as an instance of\n            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Template.  Trace templates are\n            applied cyclically to traces of each type. Container\n            arrays (eg `annotations`) have special handling: An\n            object ending in `defaults` (eg `annotationdefaults`)\n            is applied to each array item. But if an item has a\n            `templateitemname` key we look in the template array\n            for an item with matching `name` and apply that\n            instead. If no matching `name` is found we mark the\n            item invisible. Any named template item not referenced\n            is appended to the end of the array, so this can be\n            used to add a watermark annotation or a logo image, for\n            example. To omit one of these items on the plot, make\n            an item with matching `templateitemname` and `visible:\n            false`.\n        ternary\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Ternary` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        title\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Title` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        transition\n            Sets transition options used during Plotly.react\n            updates.\n        treemapcolorway\n            Sets the default treemap slice colors. Defaults to the\n            main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a\n            new list here it can still be extended with lighter and\n            darker colors, see `extendtreemapcolors`.\n        uirevision\n            Used to allow user interactions with the plot to\n            persist after `Plotly.react` calls that are unaware of\n            these interactions. If `uirevision` is omitted, or if\n            it is given and it changed from the previous\n            `Plotly.react` call, the exact new figure is used. If\n            `uirevision` is truthy and did NOT change, any\n            attribute that has been affected by user interactions\n            and did not receive a different value in the new figure\n            will keep the interaction value. `layout.uirevision`\n            attribute serves as the default for `uirevision`\n            attributes in various sub-containers. For finer control\n            you can set these sub-attributes directly. For example,\n            if your app separately controls the data on the x and y\n            axes you might set `xaxis.uirevision=*time*` and\n            `yaxis.uirevision=*cost*`. Then if only the y data is\n            changed, you can update `yaxis.uirevision=*quantity*`\n            and the y axis range will reset but the x axis range\n            will retain any user-driven zoom.\n        uniformtext\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Uniformtext`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        updatemenus\n            A tuple of\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Updatemenu`\n            instances or dicts with compatible properties\n        updatemenudefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.updatemenudefaults), sets the\n            default property values to use for elements of\n            layout.updatemenus\n        violingap\n            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between violins of\n            adjacent location coordinates.

If \"group\", the violins are\n            plotted next to one another centered around the shared\n            location. If \"overlay\", the violins are plotted over\n            one another, you might need to set \"opacity\" to see\n            them multiple violins. Has no effect on traces that\n            have \"width\" set.\n        waterfallgap\n            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of\n            adjacent location coordinates.\n        waterfallgroupgap\n            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the\n            same location coordinate.\n        waterfallmode\n            Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are\n            displayed on the graph.

May be an integer\n            number of pixels, or a percentage of bar width (as a\n            string ending in %).\n        bargap\n            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of\n            adjacent location coordinates.\n        bargroupgap\n            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the\n            same location coordinate.\n        barmode\n            Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are\n            displayed on the graph. With \"stack\", the bars are\n            stacked on top of one another With \"relative\", the bars\n            are stacked on top of one another, with negative values\n            below the axis, positive values above With \"group\", the\n            bars are plotted next to one another centered around\n            the shared location. With \"overlay\", the bars are\n            plotted over one another, you might need to reduce\n            \"opacity\" to see multiple bars.\n        barnorm\n            Sets the normalization for bar traces on the graph.\n            With \"fraction\", the value of each bar is divided by\n            the sum of all values at that location coordinate.\n            \"percent\" is the same but multiplied by 100 to show\n            percentages.\n        boxgap\n            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between boxes of\n            adjacent location coordinates. Has no effect on traces\n            that have \"width\" set.\n        boxgroupgap\n            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between boxes of the\n            same location coordinate. Has no effect on traces that\n            have \"width\" set.\n        boxmode\n            Determines how boxes at the same location coordinate\n            are displayed on the graph. If \"group\", the boxes are\n            plotted next to one another centered around the shared\n            location. If \"overlay\", the boxes are plotted over one\n            another, you might need to set \"opacity\" to see them\n            multiple boxes. Has no effect on traces that have\n            \"width\" set.\n        calendar\n            Sets the default calendar system to use for\n            interpreting and displaying dates throughout the plot.\n        clickmode\n            Determines the mode of single click interactions.\n            \"event\" is the default value and emits the\n            `plotly_click` event. In addition this mode emits the\n            `plotly_selected` event in drag modes \"lasso\" and\n            \"select\", but with no event data attached (kept for\n            compatibility reasons). The \"select\" flag enables\n            selecting single data points via click. This mode also\n            supports persistent selections, meaning that pressing\n            Shift while clicking, adds to / subtracts from an\n            existing selection. \"select\" with `hovermode`: \"x\" can\n            be confusing, consider explicitly setting `hovermode`:\n            \"closest\" when using this feature. Selection events are\n            sent accordingly as long as \"event\" flag is set as\n            well. When the \"event\" flag is missing, `plotly_click`\n            and `plotly_selected` events are not fired.\n        coloraxis\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Coloraxis` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        colorscale\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Colorscale`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        colorway\n            Sets the default trace colors.\n        computed\n            Placeholder for exporting automargin-impacting values\n            namely `margin.t`, `margin.b`, `margin.l` and\n            `margin.r` in \"full-json\" mode.\n        datarevision\n            If provided, a changed value tells `Plotly.react` that\n            one or more data arrays has changed. This way you can\n            modify arrays in-place rather than making a complete\n            new copy for an incremental change. If NOT provided,\n            `Plotly.react` assumes that data arrays are being\n            treated as immutable, thus any data array with a\n            different identity from its predecessor contains new\n            data.\n        dragmode\n            Determines the mode of drag interactions. \"select\" and\n            \"lasso\" apply only to scatter traces with markers or\n            text. \"orbit\" and \"turntable\" apply only to 3D scenes.\n        editrevision\n            Controls persistence of user-driven changes in\n            `editable: true` configuration, other than trace names\n            and axis titles.

Colors provided in the\n            trace, using `marker.colors`, are never extended.\n        font\n            Sets the global font. Note that fonts used in traces\n            and other layout components inherit from the global\n            font.\n        funnelareacolorway\n            Sets the default funnelarea slice colors. Defaults to\n            the main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you\n            specify a new list here it can still be extended with\n            lighter and darker colors, see\n            `extendfunnelareacolors`.\n        funnelgap\n            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of\n            adjacent location coordinates.\n        funnelgroupgap\n            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the\n            same location coordinate.\n        funnelmode\n            Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are\n            displayed on the graph.

Has only an effect only on graphs that have\n            been generated via forked graphs from the Chart Studio\n            Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-\n            premise).\n        hoverdistance\n            Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look for data\n            to add hover labels (-1 means no cutoff, 0 means no\n            looking for data). This is only a real distance for\n            hovering on point-like objects, like scatter points.\n            For area-like objects (bars, scatter fills, etc)\n            hovering is on inside the area and off outside, but\n            these objects will not supersede hover on point-like\n            objects in case of conflict.\n        hoverlabel\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Hoverlabel`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        hovermode\n            Determines the mode of hover interactions. If\n            \"closest\", a single hoverlabel will appear for the\n            \"closest\" point within the `hoverdistance`. If \"x\" (or\n            \"y\"), multiple hoverlabels will appear for multiple\n            points at the \"closest\" x- (or y-) coordinate within\n            the `hoverdistance`, with the caveat that no more than\n            one hoverlabel will appear per trace.

If you specify a\n            new list here it can still be extended with lighter and\n            darker colors, see `extendsunburstcolors`.\n        template\n            Default attributes to be applied to the plot. This\n            should be a dict with format: `{'layout':\n            layoutTemplate, 'data': {trace_type: [traceTemplate,\n            ...], ...}}` where `layoutTemplate` is a dict matching\n            the structure of `figure.layout` and `traceTemplate` is\n            a dict matching the structure of the trace with type\n            `trace_type` (e.g. 'scatter'). Alternatively, this may\n            be specified as an instance of\n            plotly.graph_objs.layout.Template.  Trace templates are\n            applied cyclically to traces of each type. Container\n            arrays (eg `annotations`) have special handling: An\n            object ending in `defaults` (eg `annotationdefaults`)\n            is applied to each array item. But if an item has a\n            `templateitemname` key we look in the template array\n            for an item with matching `name` and apply that\n            instead. If no matching `name` is found we mark the\n            item invisible. Any named template item not referenced\n            is appended to the end of the array, so this can be\n            used to add a watermark annotation or a logo image, for\n            example. To omit one of these items on the plot, make\n            an item with matching `templateitemname` and `visible:\n            false`.\n        ternary\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Ternary` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        title\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Title` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        transition\n            Sets transition options used during Plotly.react\n            updates.\n        treemapcolorway\n            Sets the default treemap slice colors. Defaults to the\n            main `colorway` used for trace colors. If you specify a\n            new list here it can still be extended with lighter and\n            darker colors, see `extendtreemapcolors`.\n        uirevision\n            Used to allow user interactions with the plot to\n            persist after `Plotly.react` calls that are unaware of\n            these interactions. If `uirevision` is omitted, or if\n            it is given and it changed from the previous\n            `Plotly.react` call, the exact new figure is used. If\n            `uirevision` is truthy and did NOT change, any\n            attribute that has been affected by user interactions\n            and did not receive a different value in the new figure\n            will keep the interaction value. `layout.uirevision`\n            attribute serves as the default for `uirevision`\n            attributes in various sub-containers. For finer control\n            you can set these sub-attributes directly. For example,\n            if your app separately controls the data on the x and y\n            axes you might set `xaxis.uirevision=*time*` and\n            `yaxis.uirevision=*cost*`. Then if only the y data is\n            changed, you can update `yaxis.uirevision=*quantity*`\n            and the y axis range will reset but the x axis range\n            will retain any user-driven zoom.\n        uniformtext\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Uniformtext`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        updatemenus\n            A tuple of\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.Updatemenu`\n            instances or dicts with compatible properties\n        updatemenudefaults\n            When used in a template (as\n            layout.template.layout.updatemenudefaults), sets the\n            default property values to use for elements of\n            layout.updatemenus\n        violingap\n            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between violins of\n            adjacent location coordinates. Has no effect on traces\n            that have \"width\" set.\n        violingroupgap\n            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between violins of the\n            same location coordinate. Has no effect on traces that\n            have \"width\" set.\n        violinmode\n            Determines how violins at the same location coordinate\n            are displayed on the graph. If \"group\", the violins are\n            plotted next to one another centered around the shared\n            location. If \"overlay\", the violins are plotted over\n            one another, you might need to set \"opacity\" to see\n            them multiple violins. Has no effect on traces that\n            have \"width\" set.\n        waterfallgap\n            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of\n            adjacent location coordinates.\n        waterfallgroupgap\n            Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of the\n            same location coordinate.\n        waterfallmode\n            Determines how bars at the same location coordinate are\n            displayed on the graph. With \"group\", the bars are\n            plotted next to one another centered around the shared\n            location. With \"overlay\", the bars are plotted over one\n            another, you might need to reduce \"opacity\" to see\n            multiple bars.\n        width\n            Sets the plot's width (in px).\n        xaxis\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.XAxis` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        yaxis\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.YAxis` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        \nDid you mean \"title\"?\n\nBad property path:\ntitlefont_size\n^^^^^^^^^"
