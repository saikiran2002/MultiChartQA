7,"figure 12.12: (a) estimates of the “scaling factors” by which we have to multiply the amplitude of several model-simulated signals to reproducethe corresponding changes in the observed record. the vertical bars indicate the 5 to 95% uncertainty range due to internal variability. a rangeencompassing unity implies that this combination of forcing amplitude and model-simulated response is consistent with the correspondingobserved change, while a range encompassing zero implies that this model-simulated signal is not detectable (allen and stott, 2000; stott et al.,2000a). signals are defined as the ensemble mean response to external forcing expressed in large-scale (>5000 km) near-surface temperatures overthe 1946 to 1996 period relative to the 1896 to 1996 mean. the first entry (g) shows the scaling factor and 5 to 95% confidence interval obtainedif we assume the observations consist only of a response to greenhouse gases plus internal variability. the range is significantly less than one(consistent with results from other models), meaning that models forced with greenhouse gases alone significantly overpredict the observedwarming signal. the next eight entries show scaling factors for model-simulated responses to greenhouse and sulphate forcing (gs), with twocases including indirect sulphate and tropospheric ozone forcing, one of these also including stratospheric ozone depletion (gsi and gsio respec-tively). all but one (cgcm1) of these ranges is consistent with unity. hence there is little evidence that models are systematically over- or under-predicting the amplitude of the observed response under the assumption that model-simulated gs signals and internal variability are an adequaterepresentation (i.e. that natural forcing has had little net impact on this diagnostic). observed residual variability is consistent with this assumptionin all but one case (echam3, indicated by the asterisk). we are obliged to make this assumption to include models for which only a simulationof the anthropogenic response is available, but uncertainty estimates in these single-signal cases are incomplete since they do not account foruncertainty in the naturally forced response. these ranges indicate, however, the high level of confidence with which we can reject internalvariability as simulated by these various models as an explanation of recent near-surface temperature change. a more complete uncertainty analysis is provided by the next three entries, which show corresponding scaling factors on individualgreenhouse (g), sulphate (s), solar-plus-volcanic (n), solar-only (so) and volcanic-only (v) signals for those cases in which the relevant simula-tions have been performed.  in these cases, we estimate multiple factors simultaneously to account for uncertainty in the amplitude of the naturallyforced response. the uncertainties increase but the greenhouse signal remains consistently detectable. in one case (echam3) the model appearsto be overestimating the greenhouse response (scaling range in the g signal inconsistent with unity), but this result is sensitive to whichcomponent of the control is used to define the detection space.  it is also not known how it would respond to the inclusion of a volcanic signal. incases where both solar and volcanic forcing is included (hadcm2 and hadcm3), g and s signals remain detectable and consistent with unityindependent of whether natural signals are estimated jointly or separately (allowing for different errors in s and v responses).

at which levels of impact and/or risk are undetectable (white), moderate (yellow), high (red) or very high (purple). the colour scheme thus indicates the additional risks due to climate change. the transition from red to purple, introduced for the first time in ar4, is defined by very high risk of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibility, or persistence of climate-related hazards combined with a limited ability to adapt due to the nature of the hazard or impact. comparison of the increase of risk across rfcs indicates the relative sensitivity of rfcs to increases in gmst. as was done previously, this assessment takes autonomous adaptation into account, as well as limits to adaptation (rfc 1, 3, 5) independently of development pathway. the rate and timing of impacts were taken into account in assessing rfc 1 and 5. the levels of risk illustrated reflect the judgements of the ch 3 authors. rfc1 unique and threatened systems: ecological and human systems that have restricted geographic ranges constrained by climate related conditions and have high endemism or other distinctive properties. examples include coral reefs, the arctic and its indigenous

rain, drought and associated wildfires, and coastal flooding. rfc3 distribution of impacts: risks/impacts that disproportionately affect particular groups due to uneven distribution of physical climate change hazards, exposure or vulnerability. rfc4 global aggregate impacts: global monetary damage, global scale degradation and loss of ecosystems and biodiversity. rfc5 large-scale singular

during extreme high-water  events has become deeper due to local RSL  rise and more frequent from a fixed-elevation  perspective.78, 101, 102, 103 Trends in annual fre- quencies surpassing local emergency pre- paredness thresholds for minor tidal flooding  (i.e., “nuisance” levels of about 30–60 cm [1–2  feet]) that begin to flood infrastructure and  trigger coastal flood “advisories” by NOAA’s  National Weather Service have increased 5- to  10-fold or more since the 1960s along the U.S.  coastline,104 as shown in Figure 12.5a.', 'In fact, over the last  several decades, minor tidal flood rates have  been accelerating within several (more than  25) East and Gulf Coast cities with established  elevation thresholds for minor (nuisance)  flood impacts, fastest where elevation thresh- olds are lower, local RSL rise is higher, and  extreme variability less.104, 105, 106 Trends in extreme water levels (for example,  monthly maxima) in excess of mean sea levels  (for example, monthly means) exist, but are  not commonplace.48, 101, 107, 108, 109 More common  are regional time dependencies in high-water  probabilities, which can co-vary on an interan- nual basis with climatic and other patterns.101,  110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115 These patterns are often associ- ated with anomalous oceanic and atmospheric  conditions.116, 117 For instance, the probability  of experiencing minor tidal flooding is com- pounded during El Niño periods along por- tions of the West and Mid-Atlantic Coasts105  from a combination of higher sea levels and  enhanced synoptic forcing and storm surge  frequency.112, 118, 119, 120 12.6.2 Influence of Projected Sea Level Rise on  Coastal Flood Frequencies The extent and depth of minor-to-major  coastal flooding during high-water events  will continue to increase in the future as local  RSL rises.71, 76, 78, 105, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125 Relative to  fixed elevations, the frequency of high-water  events will increase the fastest where extreme  variability is less and the rate of local RSL  rise is higher.71, 76, 105, 121, 124, 126 Under the RCP- based probabilistic RSL projections of Kopp  et al.', '2014,76 at tide gauge locations along the  contiguous U.S. coastline, a median 8-fold  increase (range of 1.1- to 430-fold increase)  is expected by 2050 in the annual number of  floods exceeding the elevation of the current  100-year flood event (measured with respect  to a 1991–2009 baseline sea level).124 Under  the same forcing, the frequency of minor  tidal flooding (with contemporary recurrence  intervals

(b) and (c) show an estimate of theobserved amplitude of a greenhouse gas signal (horizontal axis) and a sulphate aerosol signal (vertical axis) estimated simultaneously. both signalamplitudes can be estimated as positive from observations based on echam3/lsg fingerprints shown in (b) while only the greenhouse gas signalis detected based on hadcm2 fingerprints shown in panel (c). the amplitudes of both signals from the observations are compared with those frommodel simulations forced with various forcing histories and using different climate models (1: hadcm2; 2: echam3/lsg; 3: gfdl; 4:echam4/opyc; 5: cccma1; 6: cccma2). simulations with symbols shown in black are consistent with observations relative to the uncertaintyin observations (grey ellipse) and that of the model simulations (not shown). simulations which are inconsistent are shown in grey. model simula-tions where only a single ensemble member is available are illustrated by thin symbols, those based on ensembles of simulations by fat symbols.results from consistency tests indicate that most greenhouse gas only simulations (g, shown by “×”) are inconsistent with observations. ten ofthe gs simulations in both panels are in agreement with observed trend patterns, discrepancies arise mostly from the magnitude of a sulphate signal(vertical axis). the failure to detect a sulphate signal as well as a greenhouse gas signal in panel (c) is due to the two signals being very highlycorrelated if only spatial patterns are used- this makes separation of the signals difficult. these results show that estimates of a sulphate aerosolsignal from observations are model dependent and quite uncertain, while a single anthropogenic signal can be estimated with more confidence.all units are in °c/50 year, values in the upper right quadrant refer to a physically meaningful greenhouse warming and sulphate aerosol coolingsignal. the consistency test establishes whether the difference between a model’s and the observed amplitude estimate is significantly larger than thecombined uncertainty in the observations (internal variability + observational uncertainty) and the model simulation (internal variability). the figureis derived by updating the data used by barnett et al. (1999) (for details of the analysis see hegerl et al., 2000) and then applying a simple lineartransformation of the multi-regression results (hegerl and allen, 2000).results for 1946 to 1995 period used by barnett et al. (1999) are similar, except fewer of the models in b and c agree with observations and thecase of both signals being zero in c is not rejected. simulations of natural forcing only ending before 1998 are also rejected in that case.","['These authors show that, even if both greenhouse and other anthropogenic signals are estimated simultaneously in the observed record, a significant response to greenhouse gases remains detectable.', 'They estimate the magnitude of modelled 20th century greenhouse gas, aerosol, solar and volcanic signals in decadal mean data.', 'Despite the problem of degeneracy, positive and significant greenhouse gas and sulphate aerosol signals are consistently detected in the most recent fifty-year period (Figure 12.11) regardless of which or how many other signals are included in the analysis (Allen et al., 2000a; Stott et al., 2001).', 'The residual variability that remains after the naturally forced signals are removed from the observations of the most recent five decades are not consis- tent with model internal variability, suggesting that natural 723 Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes 724 Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes (a) (b) (c) 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 Estimated GS contribution to JJA Trend 1949-1998 Temperature increase (°C/50 years) −0.4 −0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Sul cooling (°C/50yrs) −0.4 −0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 GHG warming (°C/50yrs) −0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 −0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 GHG warming (°C/50yrs) Sul cooling (°C / 50yrs) Obs  ECHAM3/LSG HadCM2 ECHAM4/GS ECHAM4/GSI GFDL-R30 CGCM1 CGCM2 Obs 1949-98 G2 G4 G1 GS2 GS1 GS3 GS5 GS6 GS4 GSI4 Obs 1949-98 G2 G4 G1 GS2 GS1 GS3 GS5 GS6 GS4 GSI4 Figure 12.10: Comparison between the amplitude of anthropogenic signals from observed and modelled JJA trend patterns using fingerprints from two different climate models (ECHAM3/LSG and HadCM2) and data from five climate models.', '(a) Comparison of the amplitude of a single greenhouse gas + sulphate aerosol (GS) signal (expressed as change in global mean temperature [°C] over 50 years).', 'The amplitudes of both signals from the observations are compared with those from model simulations forced with various forcing histories and using different climate models (1: HadCM2; 2: ECHAM3/LSG; 3: GFDL; 4: ECHAM4/OPYC; 5: CCCma1; 6: CCCma2).', 'Accounting for sampling uncertainty in model- simulated signals indicates a greater degree of greenhouse warming and compensating aerosol cooling in the latter part of the century than shown by Tett et al.', 'The results show that the range of scaling factors includes unity (i.e., model is consistent with observations) for both the greenhouse gas and the sulphate aerosol signal, and that the scaling factors vary only to a reasonable (and consistent) extent between 50-year intervals.', 'We cannot assume that the response to sulphate forcing (relative to the greenhouse signal) is as simulated in these greenhouse-plus-sulphate simulations; nor can we assume the net response to natural forcing is negligible even though observations of surface temperature changes over the past 30 to 50 years are generally consistent with both these assump- tions.']"
